# ReadMe-Generator

## Description
This application allows the user to create a high quality README. They are able to do it by running node index.js in their terminal and after they answer a few questions, a README will be generated. 
I had to understand the logic behind the code so it could be properly used to ask the user questions and store their answers so a README could be generated from them. It took some trail and error but i was finally able to generate a readme from the answers. Using node was intereting because I was able to do everything in VS code and see where the errors were happening instead of opening an html file and inspecting it.
